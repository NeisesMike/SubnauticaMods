
Consider first the solution: 
	Every few seconds
		if depth is greater than appropriate
			set us back up above the ground,
			and let us float back down

Consider a second solution:
	Set the tooth entity-level to the same level as the terrain

Consider a third solution:
	The first time we hit the ground
		make us kinematic

I favor this third solution.
	The first solution is computationally expensive.
	I am not confident in the correctness of the second solution.

How do we tell that we've come to a rest on the ground?
	Check that our position has remained more or less constant for 1 second.

Solution 3 was indeed good, and it worked for perhaps 99% of teeth.
	For the remaining 1% we would like to implement solution 1, I think,
		but checks on the order of 10 seconds.
	We can use the depth map to check if we've sunk too far.

We are not considering the Stalkers in the spoiler area,
	but we're not sure they drop teeth anyways

Solution 3 with a dash of 1 was good,
	but sometimes the tooth was disabled before it could sink far enough,
	so we've set their cell-level to global.
